## ðŸ§Š Overview

Convective cold pools (CPs) play a central role in organizing deep convection and influencing extreme weather events. However, their large-scale detection has long been limited due to the lack of suitable near-surface observations, especially over remote regions.

This repository provides a deep learningâ€“based segmentation method that overcomes this limitation by relying only on cloud top temperature and rainfall fields â€” two variables globally available from geostationary satellites. By training U-Net architectures on high-resolution simulations, the method learns to recognize CP signatures based purely on their cloud and rainfall imprints.

In the future, this method might enable systematic, large-scale cold pool detection from spaceborne data, offering new opportunities to study convective organization across the tropics and beyond.

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shakiro7/coldPool-detection-unet.git
cd coldPool-detection-unet
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment *(optional but recommended)*

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run Inference with the Pretrained Models

The datasets and pretrained models used in the publication are hosted on Zenodo:

ðŸ“¦ [Zenodo Dataset (10.5281/zenodo.8376598)](https://zenodo.org/records/8376599)

To generate sample predictions based on the data from the `input`-folder, download at least one of the pretrained neural networks (`*.pt`) and place it in the project directory. Update the paths in the `example_prediction.py` accordingly and run the script to perform segmentation:

```bash
python example_prediction.py
```

The script will predict and output the cold pool segmentation masks based on the input fields and the selected neural network.
